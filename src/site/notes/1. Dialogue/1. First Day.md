##### Rise and shine late, toast in mouth and fateful bump
It's the first day of school at Scarlet High, a magician-youkai academy in the Scarlet Devil Mansion newly made by Remilia. The air is filled with the promise of a youthful high school life, and with the hopes of gaining more knowledge along the way about the mysteries of this land.

You wake up and look at the time on your Nitori-powered clock.
(Oh Shii-zuha autumn goddess[^1], I overslept!)
You rush to wear your clothes, bite a piece of toast and head off.

You take the path out of the Forest of Magic and make a run for it.
But suddenly...
**バッタン!!** (BUMP!!)
You bump into a girl wearing unusual gothic lolita attire, accompanied by another younger girl wearing a stylish hat.
"Ow.."
"Sorry, are you okay?", you apologise.
"Please watch where you're going, human," she calmly warned.
That other girl looks at you curiously.
"Sorry," you reply again and then keep running.
(I dunno if my mind was playing tricks or not but I could've sworn that I heard a little giggle from that other younger girl as we parted...)

##### Entrance
Still thinking about that girl you just bumped into throughout your walk, you finally reach the school gate.
A muscular red-haired Chinese woman stands against the wall of the school gate, with her head facing downwards as if she's about to doze off. As you approach the gate she suddenly raises her head,
"(*yawn*) Good Meilin- Morning, late are we?"
"Ah, sorry, I slept a bit too much, 'morning."
"That's fine, young man[^2]. A lil' sleep don't hurt anybody (*chuckles*). Good day to you!"

Feeling a bit better about your lateness, you pass through the hallway and trot to class.
(Alright, second classroom on the right of the ground floor, this should be it.)
"OK, be of good cheer now!"[^3], you tell yourself as you walk into the classroom.
The students who got here earlier are standing against desks, chatting with each other.
Many colourful heads shift their focus towards you.

**ビョーン!** (Boing!)
A familiar green-haired girl wearing a black and yellow hat jumps with glee in your face,
"Hewo, hewo! Aren't ya that guy I saw on the way to school! Nice to meet ya :DDD"
She shakes your hand almost aggressively.
"Uhh hi-"
Before she lets you say a word, she says,
"I'm Koishi, Koishi Komeiji. Welcome to Scarlet High! Me and the mansion owner's little sister are good frens here :3,"
She points with both hands at the yellow-haired girl beside her.
**ボッ!** (Whoosh!)
Flames ignite in this girl's eyes[^4] for a second, as if their collective excitement is manifesting.
"Yahoo, new toy in the Happy Meal[^5]? Flandre's the name, but you can call me Flan, hehe. I take it you're from the magician forest just yonder? Marisa's told me about you, she's your mentor, correct? I could give you a tour 'round this place if ya need one."
"Nice to meet you both. I'm (MC NAME). Yeah, I'm her apprentice, moved in the forest several months ago. I would gladly accept a tour."
You and Flandre exchange handshakes and you could feel a slight heat in her hand.
"After class, then." (Flan)
"Berigoo!"[^6] (Koi)

(Something tells you that Flandre shouldn't be messed with. You can feel an almost *destructive* aura emanating from her.)

##### Pet Club Meeting
Later in class you notice that that same girl you bumped into this morning is almost always by herself and it makes you wonder why people avoid her.

One day you're walking around the corridor bored and looking for a club to join, when you hear angry bird and cat noises coming from a clubroom.
**クエー!!** (CAW!!)
**ニャア!!** (MREEOOW!!)
You look into the door window.
The club looks devoid of members besides all the animals that reside in it. It's just that girl looking depressed with her pet cat and raven who are seemingly fired up about something.
You hear her sigh to the animals, "It's useless, my reputation is ruined forever," with her head in her hands.
You slide the door open, "Sorry for interrupting, but is there something wrong?"
"It's nothing, move along please," she gestures for you to leave.
You turn around a bit to put your hand on the sliding door, ready to leave, but before that you ask: "I know it's not my business, but while i was passing by I heard you saying something about your reputation. Sorry to hear that..? But how did you anger the animals?"
She looks at you with a sad look in her eyes and says "My pets are telling me to be more sociable."
"Wow, you can talk to animals, that's cool. Go on."
"There are rumors going on that I can read people's minds and many people are put off by it."
"But youkai have all sorts of abilities, right? So what sets you apart?" you ask.
"I freak people out because I can see their deepest, darkest thoughts... You're afraid too, right?"
"...Well.. it's certainly a curious ability, but my family has dealt with a lot of youkai so I can't say I'm *that* surprised."
"Acting tough are we?"
She smirks cheekily as you feel a bit embarassed.
"In all seriousness, I appreciate your concern for me though."
