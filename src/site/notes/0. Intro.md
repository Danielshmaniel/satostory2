*What if i make a romcom drama VN about Satori Komeiji the mind reader?*
*What would it be like to have a gf that can read your thoughts, and the funny implications of it?*

*Welcome to Scarlet High, the Scarlet Mansion Academy where human-magicians and youkai alike can learn the secrets of this hidden land. A place where even bakas and birdbrains can educate themselves.*

***"You are the Apple of my Eye,
the thing my Third Eye has been locked on ever since it's seen you.
It sleeps with this image of you that leaves it sleepless."***
