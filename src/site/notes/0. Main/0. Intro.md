*What if i make a romcom drama VN about Satori Komeiji the mind reader?*
*What would it be like to have a gf that can read your thoughts, and the funny implications of it?*

*Welcome to Scarlet High, the Scarlet Mansion Academy where human-magicians and youkai alike can learn the secrets of this hidden land. A place where even bakas and birdbrains can educate themselves.*

***"You are the Apple of my Eye,
the figure my Third Eye has locked onto ever since it's caught sight of you.
I sleep with this lulling image, and yet, you leave me sleepless."*** [^1]
